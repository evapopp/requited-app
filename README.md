# 📱 Requited App

A simple mobile app built with **React Native + Expo** that helps two users stay aligned.  
Each week (or on a custom schedule), the app sends both users a push notification with a prompt.  
They reply in-app, and if their responses match, they’re instantly notified that they’re in agreement.  
If their responses differ, no notification is sent.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔔 Recurring push notifications
